# Introduction

Our API allows Avanti SaaS clients to access and update information in Avanti securely. Use the API to build private services that integrate Avanti with other platforms, create custom reports, display dashboards, and more.

All endpoints in the Avanti API are based on Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture and are accessed via HTTPS. The base URL for all requests is the organization’s Avanti Self-Service Portal address with a **-API** suffix. 

> For example, if your Self-Service Portal is https&#58;//myavanti.ca/ABCInc, the base URL for API calls is https&#58;//myavanti.ca/ABCInc-api.

## Using Avanti's API

Creating an integration requires a developer familiar with leveraging API endpoints to build your integration. If you don’t have an API developer on staff, you can involve a third-party developer. 

Regardless of whether you’re using an in-house or third-party developer, the process for integrating using an API is identical. You’ll find everything you need to provide your developer outlined on the [Getting Started](https://avanti.stoplight.io/docs/avanti-api/ZG9jOjk3NDQ0NDY-getting-started) page.

We are continually adding new endpoints, features and updates. Visit [Updates](https://avanti.stoplight.io/docs/avanti-api/ZG9jOjgxNDM2NzU-updates) for more information on our latest changes.

#### What to build

With all the features of the Avanti API, you can create powerful integrations between Avanti and your other systems. Below are just a few of the many things our API allow your business to achieve.

- Access employee information and synchronize changes
- Create user accounts when employees are on-boarded
- Initiate background or credit checks for new hires
- Connect to social networks such as LinkedIn, Indeed or others

#### Custom endpoints

To meet the needs of all our customers, you can create custom endpoints using Avanti’s Reporting tools. The Reporter endpoint can access the contents of any report created in Report Designer. [Custom Endpoints](https://avanti.stoplight.io/docs/avanti-api/ZG9jOjgxNDM2NzE-custom-endpoints) explains setting up the report, and [Reporter](https://avanti.stoplight.io/docs/avanti-api/b3A6NjA3NTk0OA-get-report-data-with-options) provides details on the endpoints.
