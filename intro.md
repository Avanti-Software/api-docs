# Introduction to Avanti API

The Avanti API allows clients to securely access and or update information in Avanti. The API can be used to build private services that integrate Avanti with other platforms, create custom reports, dashboards and more.

All endpoints in the Avanti API are based on Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture and are accessed via HTTPS. The base URL for all requests is the organizations Avanti Self-Service Portal address with a **-API** suffix. Example: if an organization accesses their self-service portal at the URL [https://myavanti.ca/contoso]() the base URL for API calls will be [https://myavanti.ca/contoso-api]().

The Avanti API is continuously being updated, as new features are added to Avanti applications related endpoints will be added to the API. Visit our [Updates](/updates) page for more information on new and upcoming API changes.

If you none of our existing endpoints currently meet your needs you can try creating your own endpoints using Avantiâ€™s Reporting tools, the raw data of any custom report can be accessed via the Reporter endpoint. See the [Reporter API reference]() for more details.
