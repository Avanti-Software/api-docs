# Introduction to Avanti API

The Avanti API allows clients to access and update information in Avanti securely. Use the API to build private services that integrate Avanti with other platforms, create custom reports, display dashboards, and more.

All endpoints in the Avanti API are based on Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture and are accessed via HTTPS. The base URL for all requests is the organization’s Avanti Self-Service Portal address with a **-API** suffix. For example, if your Self-Service Portal is https://myavanti.ca/ABCInc, the base URL for API calls is https://myavanti.ca/ABCInc-api.

Avanti is continuously updating our API! We will add new endpoints to the API as we add new features in the Avanti applications. Visit [Updates](/updates) for more information on our new API endpoints and the latest changes.

If none of our existing endpoints meet your needs, you can create endpoints using Avanti’s Reporting tools. The Reporter endpoint can access the contents of any report created in Report Designer. [Custom Endpoints](/custom-endpoints) will walk you through setting up the report, and [Reporter API Reference](/reporter/get-report-data) provides details on the endpoints. 

## Early Access

The Avanti API is currently in early access. While we will avoid making any breaking changes before version 1.0 is officially released, the endpoints will not be finalized until that time. Want to learn about the latest changes to the API endpoints? Visit [Updates](/updates). 

As an early access user, we would love to hear any feedback about your experience using the Avanti API. Please email us at [AppFeedback@avanti.ca](mailto:appfeedback@avanti.ca) to help us improve the Avanti API.
