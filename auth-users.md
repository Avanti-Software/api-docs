# Avanti User

A valid Class A (Administrator) or Class B (Manager) Avanti User is required to make authenticated calls to the Avanti API. The Avanti User is used to determine access and role permissions to employees in Avanti. A dedicated user should be created for the sole purpose of authenticating with the API. Additional users can be created for different services as needed to assign the appropriate permissions. For example if you are integrating with both an HR and time collection service you would create two users one that has the necessary HR roles and another with the necessary time collection roles.

Avanti users are created in the Avanti desktop application from the Maintain Avanti User program found under System Access Controls. The user must be **Active**, use **Avanti Security** and be assigned **Group Memberships** with access to the company you want to use for your service.
