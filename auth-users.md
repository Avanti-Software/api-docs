# Avanti User

A valid Avanti User is required to make authenticated calls to the Avanti API. This user determines access and role permissions to employees in Avanti. We recommend creating a dedicated Avanti User for the sole purpose of authenticating with the API. 

Additional users can be created for different services as necessary to ensure the appropriate permissions. For example, you should have two users if you are integrating with both a human resources and time collection service â€“ a user with the necessary HR roles and another with the necessary time collection roles.

You can create a user on the Avanti Desktop Application in Avanti Users. You may need to coordinate with the Avanti Administrator within your organization to set up the Avanti User. The user must: 
- be **Active**
- have a **Regular** or **Manager Self Service** User Class
- use **Avanti Security** 
- have a **User Group** with access to the company and the required pay groups 
- have the role permissions to the required employee positions granted in **User Role Assignments**
